- Skeleton
  Created from scratch. Referenced online tutorial found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymqWGzsZD38
  Used in App.js as placeholder for navbar (icon/avatar image and nav menu). All other components use block
  loader before loading.
  In getData.js, a proxy is selected. solace seems to load the page faster. people will demonstrate the loading components better.

Additional Notes:
I used multiple components from more than one library. I even created a skeleton component from scratch with assistance
from a tutorial that also uses animation. The components used were carefully selected based on the data they are displaying.
I also nested some components.
I styled the page with built-in component styles, inline styling, and styling in a an App.css file. Some additions are subtle,
like adjusting the pagination of the employer and co-op employer tables to allow a user to select the number of rows per page.
The page is clean, with enough styling to differentiate sections and provide visual appeal.
I tested the page and attempted to eliminate any bugs/problems, such as some Course titles containing
'&amp' instead of just '&.'
